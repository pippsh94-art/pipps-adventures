## 1. Overview

Idaho is one of the most underrated camping states in the country. Over 60% of the state is public land — national forests, BLM, and wilderness areas — meaning you have virtually unlimited places to camp, many of them free. The Gem State offers everything from alpine lakes at 8,000+ feet to desert canyons, wild rivers, and natural hot springs you can soak in under the stars.

### Summer Weather (June–September)

- **Boise/Star area (2,700 ft):** Hot — highs of 85–100°F in July/August. You'll want to head to higher elevations.
- **Mountains (5,000–7,000 ft):** Perfect — highs of 70–85°F, lows of 40–55°F. Ideal camping weather.
- **High mountains (7,000+ ft):** Cool — highs of 60–75°F, lows of 30–45°F. Bring layers.
- **Monsoon season:** Late July–August can bring afternoon thunderstorms in the mountains. They usually clear by evening.
- **Fire season:** August–September. Fire restrictions are common — check before you go. Some years are worse than others for smoke.

### Why an 18ft Rig is Perfect for Idaho

Most Idaho campgrounds were built for smaller rigs. Many national forest sites have tight turns, narrow roads, and short pads. Your 18-footer will fit places that 30+ foot rigs can't touch. This opens up some of the best, most remote spots in the state.

## 4. Boondocking / Dispersed Camping

### What You Need to Know

Idaho is a boondocker's paradise. National Forest and BLM land allow free dispersed camping almost everywhere unless posted otherwise. General rules:

- **14-day stay limit** in one spot (then move at least 5 miles)
- **No fee** in most dispersed areas
- **Pack in, pack out** — no trash service
- **Camp in previously used sites** when possible (look for fire rings, cleared areas)
- **Stay on established roads and pull-offs** — don't create new sites
- **Check fire restrictions** before building any campfire — Idaho issues Stage 1–3 restrictions that can prohibit fires entirely

### Best Dispersed Camping Areas

**Boise National Forest (closest to Star)**
- **Grimes Creek Road** (east of Horseshoe Bend): Multiple pulloffs and dispersed sites along the creek. 45 min–1.5 hours from Star. Mix of dirt and gravel roads, most fine for 18ft.
- **Wilderness Ranch / Beaver Creek** (north of Boise): Forest roads with numerous dispersed sites. 1–1.5 hours.
- **Banks-Lowman Road side roads:** Turn off onto any USFS road and you'll find spots. Many are along creeks.

**Sawtooth National Forest**
- **Smiley Creek area** (south of Stanley): Wide open valley with dispersed sites along the creek. Easy access, flat.
- **Galena Summit area:** Stunning high-elevation dispersed camping with Sawtooth views.
- **East Fork Wood River** (near Ketchum): Numerous pulloffs along the river.

**Payette National Forest**
- **Warren Wagon Road** (north of McCall): Remote, gorgeous. Some rougher roads — scout first.
- **Lick Creek Road** (east of McCall): Good dispersed options with mountain views.

**BLM Land**
- **Boise Foothills / Orchard area:** Closest BLM options but lower desert — hot in summer.
- **Salmon River corridor BLM:** Various pulloffs along the river between Stanley and Challis.

### Tips for 18ft Rig Dispersed Camping

- **Scout on Google Maps satellite view** before committing to a dirt road
- **Download offline maps** (iOverlander, FreeRoam, Campendium apps are great for finding dispersed sites)
- **Watch for soft shoulders** — Idaho forest roads can have soft edges where your rig can sink
- **Back-in sites are more common** than pull-throughs in dispersed areas
- **Avoid roads rated "high clearance only"** — your 18ft should be fine on most maintained forest roads, but don't push it on unmaintained 4x4 routes
- **Arrive by early afternoon** on weekends — popular free spots fill up by Friday evening in summer

## 7. 18ft RV Tips for Idaho

### Road Conditions

- **Paved highways** (21, 55, 75): All fine, well maintained. Some winding mountain passes.
- **Maintained forest roads:** Usually gravel/dirt, passable in any RV. Watch for washboard and potholes after spring thaw (June).
- **Unmaintained forest roads:** Scout first. Some are rough — deep ruts, rocks, narrow with no turnarounds. Your 18ft can handle more than a 30-footer, but know your clearance.
- **Specific cautions:**
  - Road to Grandjean: Narrow, dirt, 25-30 min of rough road. Doable in 18ft but go slow.
  - Burgdorf road: Passable but slow (30 mph dirt road for 30 min)
  - Atlanta road: Long, rough. Not recommended for RVs unless well-maintained that year.

### Dump Stations

- **Boise:** Multiple — Walmart on Eagle Rd, Albertsons BSU area, Flying J on Garrity
- **McCall:** City dump station near the airport ($5–10)
- **Stanley:** Community dump station on Hwy 75
- **Cascade:** Valley County dump station
- **Ketchum/Hailey:** Wood River dump stations
- **Lowman:** Gas station may have dump (call ahead)
- **Pro tip:** Download the Sanidumps app — it maps every dump station in Idaho

### Water Fill-Up

- **Gas stations** in small towns (Lowman, Stanley, Cascade, McCall) usually let you fill up — ask first
- **USFS campgrounds** with water spigots — bring a hose and fill your tank
- **Boise:** Fill up at home before heading out
- **Gravity-fed mountain spring taps** exist along some highways — look for "spring water" signs

### Propane Refill

- **Star/Boise area:** Multiple — U-Haul, Tractor Supply, AmeriGas
- **McCall:** McCall Building Supply, local hardware stores
- **Cascade:** Gas stations
- **Stanley:** Limited — fill up in Boise or Ketchum
- **Ketchum/Hailey:** Hailey has propane fill stations

### Bear Country

- Central Idaho is **black bear country** (no grizzlies in most camping areas, though they're expanding south from the Selway-Bitterroot)
- Store food in your RV with doors/windows closed — don't leave coolers outside
- Keep a clean camp — trash attracts bears
- Bear spray is cheap insurance ($30–50) — carry it hiking
- Dog food and bird seed are major attractants — keep them sealed

### Fire Restrictions

- **Check before every trip:** Idaho Fire Info (idahofireinfo.com) or call the local Ranger District
- **Stage 1:** No campfires outside of developed campgrounds with metal fire rings. Camp stoves OK.
- **Stage 2:** No campfires at all, including developed campgrounds. Camp stoves may be restricted.
- **Stage 3:** Area closure — no entry.
- **Typical timing:** Restrictions start mid-July and can last through September
- **Bring a camp stove regardless** — don't rely on campfires for cooking in Idaho summer
