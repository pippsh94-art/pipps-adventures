## 1. Overview

New Mexico is the "Land of Enchantment" — and it earns the name. Stark desert mesas, 13,000 ft mountain peaks, ancient pueblos, turquoise jewelry, green chile on everything, and some of the most dramatic sunsets you'll ever see. The light here is different — artists have been drawn to Santa Fe and Taos for over a century because of it.

### What Makes New Mexico Amazing for Camping

- Enormous tracts of **BLM and National Forest land** — tons of free dispersed camping
- **High desert climate** — dry, sunny, clear skies. Incredible stargazing (some of the darkest skies in the US)
- Stunning diversity: desert canyons, alpine forests, white sand dunes, volcanic badlands, river gorges
- Rich culture: pueblos, adobe architecture, world-class food (green chile everything)
- Way **less crowded** than Colorado or Utah — New Mexico is underrated

### Weather (June–October)

- **Santa Fe (7,000 ft):** Warm, sunny — highs 75–85°F in summer, lows 50–60°F. Very pleasant. Dry heat.
- **Mountains (8,000–13,000 ft):** Cool — highs 60–75°F, lows 35–50°F. Bring layers.
- **Desert / lowlands (4,000–5,500 ft):** Hot — 90–105°F in summer. Camp at elevation to escape heat.
- **Monsoon season:** Mid-July through September. Afternoon thunderstorms roll in almost daily — dramatic cloud buildups, lightning, brief intense rain, then clear skies again. Usually over by sunset. Beautiful but be prepared.
- **Fall (September–October):** THE best time. Warm days, cool nights, golden aspens in the mountains, fewer crowds, monsoons winding down.

### The Drive

**Distance:** ~1,000 miles | **Drive time:** ~14.5–15 hours (without stops)

**Recommended: Split into 2 days**

### Route Option A: I-84 → I-15 → I-70 → I-25 (Through Utah & Colorado)

**Day 1: Star → Moab or Green River, UT (~6.5 hours)**
- Star → Twin Falls (I-84 south) — 2 hrs
- Twin Falls → I-15 south through Tremonton, UT — 2 hrs

**Pros:** More scenic, passes through Moab/Utah canyon country
**Cons:** Slightly longer, more mountain passes

### Route Option B: I-84 → I-80 → I-15 → I-70 → I-25 (Similar but via SLC)

Same idea but swings through Salt Lake City on I-15.

**Pros:** Warmer route, avoids mountain passes in shoulder season
**Cons:** Longer, more desert driving, less scenic

### Recommended: Route A with a Moab overnight

### Stops Worth Making Along the Way

|------|----------|-----|
| **Shoshone Falls** | Twin Falls, ID | "Niagara of the West" — quick detour |

### Fuel Planning
- Gas stations are reliable along I-84, I-15, I-70, and I-25
- **Watch fuel in rural Utah** (I-70 between Green River and Salida has long stretches)
- Fill up before entering any national park or backcountry area

## 9. 18ft RV Tips for New Mexico

### Road Conditions

- **Interstates (I-25, I-40):** Perfect condition. Major north-south and east-west corridors.
- **State highways:** Generally good. Hwy 4 (Jemez), Hwy 68 (Taos), Hwy 475 (Santa Fe ski road) are all paved and fine.
- **Chaco Canyon access road:** 13–21 miles of rough dirt/gravel. Washboarded and rutted. Passable in 18ft but slow (25 mph). **Do not attempt in rain** — clay becomes impassable.
- **Mountain forest roads:** Generally good in Santa Fe NF and Carson NF. Some higher roads close seasonally.
- **Desert BLM roads:** Usually fine when dry. **Dangerous when wet** — NM clay is some of the most treacherous mud you'll encounter. Even 4WD vehicles get stuck.

### Elevation & Your RV

New Mexico is HIGH. Santa Fe sits at 7,000 ft. Many campgrounds are 8,000–10,000 ft.

- **Engine performance:** Your RV will have noticeably less power at altitude. Don't be alarmed.
- **Boiling point:** Water boils at lower temps — cooking takes longer
- **Tire pressure:** Check frequently — altitude and temperature swings affect pressure
- **Altitude sickness:** Stay hydrated. Some people feel it above 8,000 ft (headache, fatigue). Acclimate.

### Dump Stations

- **Santa Fe:** Rancheros de Santa Fe RV Park, various locations
- **Albuquerque:** Multiple — Walmart, Flying J, KOA
- **Taos:** Taos Valley RV Park
- **Las Cruces:** Multiple along I-10/I-25
- **Ruidoso:** Circle B RV Park area
- **Use the Sanidumps app**

### Water Fill-Up

- **Gas stations** in towns — ask first
- **RV parks** often sell water fills ($5–$10)
- **National Forest campgrounds** with spigots — bring a hose
- **Santa Fe:** Fill up before heading into the backcountry
- **⚠️ Water is precious in the desert.** Carry extra — 5-gallon jugs minimum.

### Propane Refill

- **Santa Fe:** Suburban Propane, various retailers
- **Albuquerque:** Multiple locations
- **Taos:** Hardware stores, gas stations
- **Smaller towns:** Ask at gas stations — many rural NM stations fill propane

### Wildlife & Hazards

- **Black bears:** Present in all mountain areas (Sangre de Cristos, Jemez, Sacramento, Gila). Bear boxes at some campgrounds. Standard precautions.
- **Rattlesnakes:** Common below 7,000 ft. Watch where you step and put your hands.
- **Scorpions:** Southern NM especially. Shake out shoes and clothing left outside.
- **Tarantulas:** Harmless but startling. Common in fall (migration season — September/October).
- **Flash floods:** During monsoon season (July–September), dry washes can fill in minutes. **Never camp in a dry wash.** Never drive through flowing water.
- **Lightning:** NM gets intense lightning during monsoons. If you're above treeline (hiking Wheeler Peak, etc.), descend early afternoon.

### Fire Restrictions

- Check **firerestrictions.us** and the specific national forest website
- Restrictions are common June–August before monsoons kick in
- After monsoons start (mid-July), restrictions are sometimes lifted
- Bring a camp stove regardless

## 10. Packing Checklist

### Everything from the Idaho/Oregon lists, PLUS:

### Desert Southwest Essentials
- [ ] **Extra water** — minimum 1 gallon per person per day PLUS RV tank. Carry 5–10 extra gallons.
- [ ] Wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses (desert sun is intense, especially at altitude)
- [ ] High-SPF sunscreen (higher elevation = stronger UV)
- [ ] Electrolyte packets (dehydration sneaks up on you)
- [ ] Light, breathable long-sleeve shirts (sun protection > tank tops in desert)
- [ ] Rain jacket for monsoon season (afternoon storms come fast)
- [ ] Warm layers for mountain evenings (40s–50s even in July at 8,000+ ft)

### NM-Specific
- [ ] Snake gaiters or tall boots for desert hiking
- [ ] Shake-out routine for shoes/clothes (scorpions)
- [ ] NM State Trust Land access permit if planning to camp on state land ($35/year)
- [ ] National Park pass ($80/year — pays for itself with White Sands, Bandelier, Carlsbad, Chaco)
- [ ] Binoculars (wildlife viewing — elk, pronghorn, roadrunners, raptors)
- [ ] Star chart or stargazing app (SkySafari, Stellarium) — the dark skies demand it
- [ ] Camera with manual settings (for astrophotography — you'll want it at Chaco)

### Cultural Respect
- [ ] Cash for pueblo entry fees and photography permits
- [ ] **Respect photography rules** — many pueblos prohibit photos, sketching, and recording. Always ask.
- [ ] Modest dress when visiting pueblos and churches
