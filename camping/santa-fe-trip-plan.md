## Quick Tips

- **"Red or green?"** — Every restaurant will ask. This means red or green chile. "Christmas" = both. Always say Christmas your first time.
- **Altitude:** Santa Fe is 7,000 ft. Drink way more water than you think you need. Take it easy Day 1.
- **Monsoons (July–Sept):** Storms roll in between 2–5 PM like clockwork. Plan outdoor activities for morning. Never camp in a dry wash.
- **Respect pueblos:** They are sovereign nations and active communities, not tourist attractions. Follow all posted rules.
- **Cash:** Carry small bills for pueblo entry fees, roadside chile stands, and art purchases
- **Fall timing:** If you can go late September / early October — golden aspens, perfect weather, and the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta (first two weeks of October, 500+ balloons). Peak magic.
