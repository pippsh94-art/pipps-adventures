## 1. Overview

Oregon is Idaho's polar opposite in many ways — lush rainforests, a dramatic Pacific coastline, volcanic peaks, high desert, and river gorges. From Star, you cross into eastern Oregon quickly and enter a landscape of open rangeland, painted hills, and canyon country before climbing into the Cascades or dropping to the coast.

### What Makes Oregon Amazing for Camping

- **The entire Oregon coast is public** — no private beaches. 363 miles of coastline, all accessible.
- Incredible diversity: desert, forest, mountains, coast, volcanic landscapes — all in one state
- Extensive national forest and BLM land for free dispersed camping
- World-class hiking, fishing, and scenic drives
- Generally cooler temps than Idaho in summer (especially coast and Cascades)

### Summer Weather

- **Eastern Oregon (high desert, 3,000–5,000 ft):** Hot and dry — 85–100°F. Similar to Boise. Bring shade.
- **Cascades (4,000–7,000 ft):** Perfect — 65–85°F days, 40–55°F nights. Some higher passes don't open until late June.
- **Coast:** Cool and foggy — 55–70°F all summer. Layers are mandatory. Fog burns off by afternoon most days.
- **Central Oregon (Bend area, 3,600 ft):** Warm and sunny — 75–90°F with cool nights. 300 days of sunshine.

### Driving from Star to Oregon

- **Star to Ontario, OR (border):** ~1 hour west on I-84
- **Star to Baker City, OR:** ~2.5 hours

- **Star to Bend, OR:** ~5.5 hours

## 8. 18ft RV Tips for Oregon

### Road Conditions

- **I-84 (Star → Oregon):** Interstate, perfect condition. Your gateway to eastern Oregon.
- **Hwy 26 (John Day / Painted Hills):** Well-maintained two-lane highway. Easy.
- **Hwy 20 (Burns / Bend):** Long, straight, through high desert. Easy but remote — fuel up when you can.
- **Hwy 97 (Central Oregon):** Major north-south route. Good condition.
- **Steens Mountain Loop Road:** Gravel/dirt above Fish Lake. Narrow in places. **Doable in 18ft but go slow.** Check opening date (usually July).
- **Hat Point Road (Hells Canyon):** Narrow, winding, steep gravel. Passable but nerve-wracking in 18ft. Scout conditions first.
- **Cascade forest roads:** Variable — some are smooth gravel, others are rough. Check USFS conditions.
- **Coast (Hwy 101):** Paved but winding with some tight turns through towns. 18ft is fine.

### Dump Stations

- **Ontario, OR:** Travel centers on I-84
- **Baker City:** Oregon Trail Interpretive Center area, local RV park
- **Burns:** Burns RV Park / Safeway area
- **Bend:** Tumalo State Park, Scandia RV Park, Walmart area
- **La Grande:** Hot Lake RV Resort area
- **Joseph:** Wallowa Lake State Park (campers)
- **Coast towns:** Most state parks have dump stations (even for non-campers, small fee)
- **Sanidumps app** — maps every dump station

### Water Fill-Up

- **Gas stations in small towns** — ask politely, most will let you fill up
- **State park campgrounds** — often have water spigots accessible
- **Bend:** Multiple options
- **Fill up in Boise/Star** before crossing into eastern Oregon — towns are few and far between

### Propane Refill

- **Ontario:** Multiple stations near I-84
- **Baker City:** Local hardware/farm stores
- **Burns:** Gas stations
- **Bend:** U-Haul, Suburban Propane, local shops
- **La Grande:** Local suppliers
- **Eastern Oregon tip:** Fill up before heading into the backcountry. Propane availability is sparse between towns.

**⚠️ Eastern Oregon is REMOTE.** Gas stations can be 60–100 miles apart.

Key fuel stops:
- Ontario → Baker City (75 mi)
- Baker City → John Day (80 mi)
- John Day → Burns (70 mi)
- Burns → Bend (130 mi — **fill up in Burns!**)
- Burns → Frenchglen (60 mi — **Frenchglen has very limited fuel**)

### Oregon-Specific Rules

- **No self-serve gas** — Oregon requires attendants to pump your gas (partially relaxed for rural counties in 2023, but most stations still pump for you)
- **No sales tax** — everything you buy in Oregon is tax-free (stock up!)
- **Northwest Forest Pass** — required for parking at many USFS trailheads ($5/day or $30/year). Buy at ranger stations or REI.
- **Fire restrictions** — Oregon is strict. Check oregonsmoke.org and USFS alerts.

### Wildlife

- **Black bears:** Central and western Oregon. Same precautions as Idaho.
- **Cougars:** Present statewide. Unlikely encounter but be aware hiking.
- **Rattlesnakes:** Eastern Oregon, especially in desert/canyon areas. Watch where you step.
