> A guide for finding and buying a 1932 Ford with a flathead V8 and 5-speed transmission.

## Why the '32 Ford?

The 1932 Ford is **the** hot rod. It's where the hot rod movement started — kids in the '40s and '50s pulled fenders off these things and dropped hopped-up flatheads in them. It's the most iconic hot rod platform ever made, and it's still the gold standard today.

### What Ford Offered in 1932

| Model | Body Style | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Model 18** | V8 powered | The one you want — first mass-produced V8 |
| **Model B** | 4-cylinder | Same body, less desirable engine |

**Body styles:** Roadster, Phaeton, Coupe (3-window & 5-window), Tudor Sedan, Fordor Sedan, Victoria, Cabriolet, Pickup

### Most Desirable (and Expensive) Body Styles

1. **Roadster** (Deuce Roadster) — The holy grail. Open-top, two-seat. $60K–$200K+ depending on build quality and originality
2. **3-Window Coupe** — The classic hot rod look. $45K–$150K+
3. **5-Window Coupe** — Slightly more common, still iconic. $35K–$120K+
4. **Tudor Sedan** — More affordable entry point. $25K–$80K
5. **Pickup** — Cool factor is high. $30K–$90K
6. **Phaeton** — Open 4-seat. Rare, beautiful. $50K–$150K+

## The Flathead V8

The Ford flathead V8 (1932–1953) is one of the most legendary engines ever built. Here's what to know:

### Stock Specs (1932)

| Spec | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Displacement** | 221 cubic inches (3.6L) |
| **Horsepower** | 65 hp (stock) |
| **Torque** | 130 lb-ft |
| **Configuration** | 90° V8, L-head (flathead) |
| **Block** | Cast iron |

### Common Hop-Up Specs

Most '32 Ford hot rods you'll find for sale have been built up. Common upgrades:

| Upgrade | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bigger displacement** | 239ci (1946–48) or 255ci (Mercury, 1949–53) blocks are popular swaps. Same external dimensions. |
| **Edelbrock/Offenhauser intake** | Dual-carb or tri-power setups. Huge aftermarket even today. |
| **Isky/Winfield cam** | Hotter cam profiles for more power |
| **Headers** | Huge improvement over stock exhaust manifolds. Zoomie headers for the classic look. |
| **Ported/relieved heads** | Opens up the combustion chambers |
| **High-compression heads** | Edelbrock, Navarro, or modern aftermarket aluminum heads |
| **Realistic output** | 100–180 hp with typical street build. 200+ for serious builds. |

### What to Watch For

- **Overheating** — The #1 flathead problem. The exhaust ports run through the block next to the intake. Get a good cooling system (modern aluminum radiator, electric fan).
- **Cracked blocks** — Common, especially around the exhaust passages. Inspect carefully.
- **Oil leaks** — They all leak. It's character. But excessive leaking means worn seals/gaskets.
- **Parts availability** — Excellent. The flathead aftermarket is still thriving. Speedway Motors, Honest Charley, H&H Flatheads, etc.
- **Rebuilds** — A quality flathead rebuild runs $3,000–$8,000 depending on level.

### Flathead vs. Modern V8 Swap

Many '32 Fords on the market have small-block Chevys or Ford 302s/351s. If you want a **flathead specifically**, you're looking at a smaller but passionate market. Flathead builds are more authentic and have a sound/character that modern engines can't replicate — that lopey idle and exhaust rumble is unmistakable.

## The 5-Speed Transmission

A 5-speed in a '32 Ford is an aftermarket upgrade (the originals had 3-speed unsynchronized boxes). Here's what you'll typically find:

### Common 5-Speed Options

| Transmission | Source | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Tremec TKO 500/600** | Aftermarket | Most popular choice for hot rods. Strong, smooth shifting. 500 lb-ft torque capacity. Overdrive 5th gear. $2,500–$3,500 new. |
| **Tremec T-5** | Ford Mustang (1983–2004) | Lighter duty, good for stock-power flatheads. Common and affordable. $800–$1,500 used. |
| **Ford Top Loader** (4-speed) | Ford (1964–73) | Not a 5-speed, but worth mentioning — period-correct hot rod trans. Bulletproof. |
| **Toyota W58/R154** | Toyota Supra | Budget option some builders use. Strong, cheap, but requires adapter. |
| **S10/S15 5-speed** | GM trucks | Another budget option. Compact. |

### Why 5-Speed?

- **Overdrive** — Drops RPMs on the highway. A flathead at 3,500 RPM on the freeway is miserable. Overdrive brings it down to ~2,200 RPM at 65 mph.
- **Modern drivability** — Synchronized gears, smooth shifts
- **Fuel economy** — Matters when you're cruising to Santa Fe in your '32 😎

### Adapter Kits

If the car has a flathead + 5-speed, someone used an adapter kit. Common sources:
- **Wilcap Company** — Flathead-to-Tremec adapters (the go-to)
- **Speedway Motors** — Various adapter plates
- **H&H Flatheads** — Flathead specialists

- **5-speed equipped** adds $2,000–$4,000 in value over a 3-speed or C4 auto.

## What to Look For When Buying

### Body & Frame

- [ ] **Steel or fiberglass body?** — Ask directly. Magnet test (magnet won't stick to fiberglass). Steel is worth more.
- [ ] **Reproduction body?** — Many "steel" bodies are actually new Brookville or Dearborn Deuce reproductions (which are excellent quality but should be priced accordingly)
- [ ] **Original Henry Ford steel?** — The real deal. VIN on the frame. Worth significantly more.
- [ ] **Frame** — Original rails, aftermarket (TCI, Chassis Engineering, Pete & Jakes, SO-CAL), or custom? Aftermarket is fine — often better.
- [ ] **Rust** — Check floors, firewall, lower quarters, trunk area. '32s are 90+ years old. Some rust is expected.
- [ ] **Body filler** — Magnet test or paint thickness gauge. Some is fine, tons is a red flag.
- [ ] **Gaps and alignment** — Doors, hood, trunk lid should fit evenly.

### Engine (Flathead V8)

- [ ] **Which flathead?** — 221ci (1932–38), 239ci (1939–48), 255ci (Mercury 49–53). Ask for specifics.
- [ ] **Rebuild history** — When was it last rebuilt? By whom? Receipts/documentation?
- [ ] **Compression test** — Should be 90–120 PSI per cylinder, even across all 8
- [ ] **Oil pressure** — Should be 30–45 PSI warm at idle
- [ ] **Cooling system** — Modern aluminum radiator? Electric fan? Overheating history?
- [ ] **Exhaust leaks** — Listen carefully. Flatheads develop cracks.
- [ ] **Speed equipment** — What heads, cam, intake, carbs? Edelbrock and Offenhauser equipment is desirable.

### Transmission (5-Speed)

- [ ] **Which 5-speed?** — Tremec TKO is ideal. T-5 is okay for stock power.
- [ ] **Adapter kit** — Wilcap or other quality adapter?
- [ ] **Clutch** — Hydraulic throwout bearing is ideal (no clutch linkage headaches)
- [ ] **Shifts smoothly** — Drive it through all gears. No grinding, popping out of gear.
- [ ] **Overdrive works** — Get it on the highway and confirm 5th gear drops RPMs

### Brakes, Suspension, Steering

- [ ] **Brakes** — Disc fronts are a must for safety. Disc rears are nice. Drum-only is sketchy for modern driving.
- [ ] **Steering** — Vega box, rack-and-pinion, or cross-steer? Should be tight, no wandering.
- [ ] **Front suspension** — Dropped axle (traditional) or independent? Both are fine. IFS is smoother.
- [ ] **Rear end** — Ford 9-inch, 8-inch, or early Ford banjo? 9-inch is best.

### Electrical

- [ ] **12-volt conversion?** — Should be. 6-volt is a hassle.
- [ ] **Wiring quality** — Spaghetti wiring = fire hazard. Look for quality harness (Painless, American Autowire).
- [ ] **Turn signals, brake lights, headlights** — All working? You need them for road driving.

### Documentation & Title

- [ ] **Clean title** — Some states title these as "assembled vehicles" or "replica." Know your state's rules (Idaho is pretty friendly for hot rods).
- [ ] **Build documentation** — Photos, receipts, builder info. Adds value and trust.
- [ ] **History** — How many owners? Show history? Magazine features?

## Suggested Search Strategy

1. **Set up alerts** on Bring a Trailer, Hemmings, and ClassicCars.com for "1932 Ford"
2. **Join The H.A.M.B.** (jalopyjournal.com) — browse the classifieds weekly. This is where the flathead guys sell to each other.
3. **Join Facebook groups:** "1932 Ford Deuce Coupe," "Flathead V8 Buy Sell Trade," "Traditional Hot Rods for Sale"
4. **Be patient** — The right flathead/5-speed '32 is specific. It might take a few months to find the right one.
5. **Be ready to travel** — SoCal, Texas, and the Midwest have the most inventory. Budget for a one-way plane ticket + driving it home (which is half the fun).
6. **Budget** — For a nice flathead/5-speed driver: target **$45,000–$75,000**. You can find deals below that, and you can spend way more, but that's the sweet spot for a well-built cruiser.
