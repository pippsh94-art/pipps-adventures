<p><strong>Priority order:</strong> Beneficiary designations and trust
transfers <strong>override your will</strong>. If your 401(k)
beneficiary form names your ex-spouse, they get it — even if your will
says otherwise. This is the #1 mistake people make.</p>
<h3 id="key-tax-concepts">Key Tax Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Stepped-Up Basis:</strong> When you die, most assets get
their cost basis “stepped up” to the fair market value at the date of
death. If you bought stock at $10 and it’s worth $100 when you die, your
children inherit it at $100 — they owe <strong>zero capital
gains</strong> on the $90 of growth. This is one of the most powerful
tax benefits in the entire tax code.</p>
<p><strong>Estate Tax:</strong> Federal estate tax only applies to
estates over <strong>$13.61 million per person / $27.22 million per
couple</strong> (2024). Unless you’re above this, federal estate tax is
not a concern. Idaho has <strong>no state estate tax</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Income Tax on Inherited Accounts:</strong> Different assets
have very different tax treatment when inherited. This is where strategy
matters most.</p>

<h3 id="best-options-ranked">Best Options (Ranked)</h3>
<h4 id="option-1-revocable-living-trust-best-for-most-people">Option 1:
Revocable Living Trust ⭐ (Best for Most People)</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Transfer the deed to your trust now. At death,
successor trustee distributes per trust terms.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate entirely - Private — no
public record - Immediate transfer — kids don’t wait months - Home gets
<strong>full stepped-up basis</strong> at death (huge capital gains
savings) - In Idaho (community property state), <strong>both
halves</strong> of a jointly-owned home get stepped up at the first
spouse’s death</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - Costs $1,500–$3,000 to set up (one-time,
with full estate plan) - Must remember to actually transfer the deed</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> You bought your home for $200,000. It’s
worth $600,000 when you pass. Your children inherit it with a $600,000
basis. If they sell for $620,000, they only pay capital gains on $20,000
— not $420,000.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-transfer-on-death-deed-tod-deed">Option 2: Transfer on
Death Deed (TOD Deed)</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Record a TOD deed that automatically transfers
the home to named beneficiaries at death. You keep full ownership and
control while alive.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate - Simple and cheap ($50–$200
to record) - Revocable — you can change it anytime - Home still gets
stepped-up basis</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - <strong>Idaho adopted TOD deeds in
2019</strong> — so this is available to you - Doesn’t provide incapacity
protection (unlike a trust) - Can get complicated with multiple
beneficiaries or if a beneficiary dies before you</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a simple probate-avoidance
tool without the cost of a full trust.</p>
<h4 id="option-3-joint-tenancy-with-right-of-survivorship">Option 3:
Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Add children to the deed as joint tenants.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ Generally NOT recommended:</strong> - Triggers a
<strong>gift</strong> (potential gift tax issues on amounts over
$18,000/year per person) - Children <strong>don’t get full stepped-up
basis</strong> — they inherit your original cost basis for your share -
Exposes the home to your children’s creditors, lawsuits, and divorces -
If your child has financial problems, a lien can be placed on YOUR home
- Could affect your child’s financial aid eligibility - Capital gains
tax hit when they sell</p>
<h4 id="option-4-quitclaim-deed-gift-while-alive">❌ Option 4: Quitclaim
Deed (Gift While Alive)</h4>
<p><strong>Do NOT do this.</strong> Gifting your home before death
means: - Children get <strong>your original cost basis</strong> (no
step-up) — potentially massive capital gains tax - You lose the
$250K/$500K primary residence capital gains exclusion - You lose control
of your home - Potential gift tax implications - Possible Medicaid
lookback issues</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Let your home transfer at death for the
stepped-up basis. Don’t gift it early.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="cash-bank-accounts">3. Cash &amp; Bank Accounts</h2>
<h3 id="best-options-ranked-1">Best Options (Ranked)</h3>
<h4 id="option-1-payable-on-death-pod-designation">Option 1: Payable on
Death (POD) Designation ⭐</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Go to your bank and add a <strong>POD
beneficiary</strong> to each account. At death, the beneficiary brings a
death certificate and the account transfers immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate - Free to set up - Instant
transfer - You keep full control while alive — beneficiary has zero
access until your death - No tax consequences (cash doesn’t appreciate,
so no capital gains issue)</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - Equal splits can be awkward (need to split
across accounts or name percentages) - Doesn’t provide incapacity
protection</p>
<h4 id="option-2-hold-in-a-revocable-trust">Option 2: Hold in a
Revocable Trust</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Retitle bank accounts in the name of your
trust. Distributed per trust terms at death.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate - Incapacity protection
(successor trustee manages if you can’t) - Can include conditions (age
restrictions, staggered distributions, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - Slightly more paperwork to set up</p>
<h4 id="option-3-joint-account">Option 3: Joint Account</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Add child to the account as joint owner.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ Risky:</strong> - Child has immediate access — can
withdraw everything - Exposed to child’s creditors and lawsuits - Could
be considered a gift for tax purposes - Can create family conflict if
one child is on the account but others aren’t - Only use this if you
genuinely want the child to have access NOW (e.g., helping manage your
finances)</p>
<h3 id="tax-impact">Tax Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cash inheritance is <strong>not taxable income</strong> to your
children</li>
<li>Any interest earned after transfer is taxable to them</li>
<li>No step-up basis issue (cash is cash)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="traditional-ira-401k">4. Traditional IRA &amp; 401(k)</h2>
<h3 id="these-are-the-most-tax-complicated-assets-to-inherit">⚠️ These
Are the Most Tax-Complicated Assets to Inherit</h3>
<p>Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are <strong>pre-tax money</strong> —
your children will owe income tax on every dollar they withdraw. This is
the biggest tax bill in most inheritances.</p>
<h3 id="the-secure-act-rules-2020">The SECURE Act Rules (2020+)</h3>
<p>The SECURE Act eliminated the “stretch IRA” for most non-spouse
beneficiaries. Here’s how it works now:</p>
<h4 id="spouse-inherits-best-treatment">Spouse Inherits → Best
Treatment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can roll into their own IRA — treated as if it was always
theirs</li>
<li>Can delay RMDs until their own required age (73/75)</li>
<li>Can name new beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong>This is the best outcome for tax deferral</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="children-inherit-10-year-rule">Children Inherit → 10-Year
Rule</h4>
<ul>
<li>Non-spouse beneficiaries must withdraw the <strong>entire balance
within 10 years</strong> of your death</li>
<li>If you were already taking RMDs, they must also take annual
distributions during the 10 years</li>
<li>If you hadn’t started RMDs, they can wait and take it all in year 10
(but that creates a massive tax bomb)</li>
<li><strong>No more lifetime stretch</strong> — this was a huge
change</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="exceptions-to-the-10-year-rule">Exceptions to the 10-Year
Rule</h4>
<p>These beneficiaries can still stretch over their lifetime: -
Surviving spouse - Minor children (until age 21, then 10-year clock
starts) - Disabled or chronically ill individuals - Beneficiaries less
than 10 years younger than you</p>
<h3 id="strategies-to-minimize-the-tax-hit">Strategies to Minimize the
Tax Hit</h3>
<h4 id="strategy-1-roth-conversions-before-death">Strategy 1: Roth
Conversions Before Death ⭐⭐⭐</h4>
<p><strong>The single best thing you can do.</strong> Convert
traditional IRA/401(k) money to Roth while you’re alive, especially in
early retirement when your tax bracket is low.</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay the tax now at (presumably) a lower rate</li>
<li>Your children inherit a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> — still subject to
the 10-year rule, but <strong>all withdrawals are tax-free</strong></li>
<li>A $500,000 Roth IRA inherited is worth $500,000. A $500,000
traditional IRA inherited might only be worth $350,000 after taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> - Traditional IRA: $500,000. Children
withdraw over 10 years. At a 24% bracket, they net ~$380,000. - Roth
IRA: $500,000. You paid tax during conversion at 12-22% (in early
retirement). Children get the full $500,000 tax-free. - <strong>Savings:
$50,000–$120,000+ in taxes</strong></p>
<h4
id="strategy-2-coordinate-withdrawals-with-childrens-income">Strategy 2:
Coordinate Withdrawals with Children’s Income</h4>
<p>If your children have variable income (self-employed, between jobs,
lower-earning years), they should take larger distributions in
low-income years to minimize the tax bracket impact.</p>
<h4 id="strategy-3-charitable-beneficiary-for-ira">Strategy 3:
Charitable Beneficiary for IRA</h4>
<p>If you’re charitably inclined, name a <strong>charity as the IRA
beneficiary</strong> (or partial beneficiary). The charity pays zero tax
on the IRA distribution. Leave other assets (home, brokerage — which get
stepped-up basis) to your children instead. This is the most
tax-efficient allocation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IRAs → Charity</strong> (avoids all income tax)</li>
<li><strong>Brokerage + Home → Children</strong> (stepped-up basis,
minimal/no capital gains)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strategy-4-qualified-charitable-distribution-qcd">Strategy 4:
Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)</h4>
<p>After age 70½, donate up to $105,000/year directly from your IRA to
charity. Reduces your IRA balance (less for kids to pay tax on) while
satisfying your charitable goals and RMD obligations.</p>
<h3 id="k-specific-notes">401(k) Specific Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>If still employed past 73, you can delay RMDs on your current
employer’s 401(k)</li>
<li>Roll old 401(k)s into an IRA for more flexibility and easier
beneficiary management</li>
<li>Some 401(k) plans have restrictive beneficiary payout options — an
IRA gives your kids more control</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming-beneficiaries-do-it-right">Naming Beneficiaries — Do It
Right</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary beneficiary:</strong> Spouse (usually)</li>
<li><strong>Contingent beneficiary:</strong> Children (list each by name
and percentage — not “my children”)</li>
<li><strong>Review after:</strong> Divorce, remarriage, death of a
beneficiary, birth of a grandchild</li>
<li><strong>Never name your estate</strong> as IRA beneficiary — forces
probate AND may accelerate taxation</li>
<li><strong>Never name your trust</strong> as IRA beneficiary unless
it’s specifically designed as a “conduit” or “accumulation” trust
(requires attorney setup) — otherwise you can lose stretch/deferral
benefits</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="roth-ira-roth-401k">5. Roth IRA &amp; Roth 401(k)</h2>
<h3 id="the-best-asset-to-leave-your-children">The Best Asset to Leave
Your Children ⭐⭐⭐</h3>
<p><strong>Why Roth is king for inheritance:</strong> - Children still
must withdraw within <strong>10 years</strong> (SECURE Act) - But every
dollar comes out <strong>completely tax-free</strong> - No income tax,
no capital gains tax, nothing - The Roth has already been taxed (you
paid tax on contributions/conversions)</p>
<h3
id="strategy-prioritize-spending-traditional-preserving-roth">Strategy:
Prioritize Spending Traditional, Preserving Roth</h3>
<p>In retirement, spend down your traditional IRA/401(k) first (or
convert to Roth). Leave the Roth to grow tax-free as long as possible.
The Roth is the most valuable asset to pass on because of its tax-free
status.</p>
<p><strong>Spending order for retirement (optimized for
inheritance):</strong> 1. Taxable brokerage accounts (get stepped-up
basis at death anyway) 2. Traditional IRA/401(k) (reduces future tax
burden for kids) 3. Roth IRA (preserve this — most valuable
inheritance)</p>
<p>Wait — that conflicts slightly. The optimal order depends on your tax
bracket and goals. A financial advisor can model this for your specific
situation. The general principle: <strong>Roth is the most tax-efficient
asset to leave behind.</strong></p>
<h3 id="roth-401k">Roth 401(k)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roll into a Roth IRA before death if possible — gives beneficiaries
more flexibility</li>
<li>Roth 401(k)s are now exempt from RMDs during your lifetime (SECURE
2.0, effective 2024)</li>
<li>Same 10-year rule applies to inherited Roth 401(k)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="brokerage-taxable-investment-accounts">6. Brokerage / Taxable
Investment Accounts</h2>
<h3 id="the-second-best-asset-to-leave-your-children">The Second-Best
Asset to Leave Your Children</h3>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> The <strong>stepped-up cost basis</strong>
makes taxable brokerage accounts extremely tax-efficient to inherit.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>
<p>You buy $200,000 of stock. It grows to $800,000. If you sell while
alive, you owe capital gains on $600,000 of gains (~$90,000–$140,000 in
taxes).</p>
<p>If you <strong>hold until death</strong>, your children inherit at
the $800,000 stepped-up basis. If they sell the next day for $800,000,
they owe <strong>$0 in capital gains.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The $600,000 of gains is never taxed. Ever.</strong> This is
the most powerful tax benefit in estate planning.</p>
<h3 id="best-transfer-options">Best Transfer Options</h3>
<h4 id="option-1-transfer-on-death-tod-registration">Option 1: Transfer
on Death (TOD) Registration ⭐</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Add a TOD beneficiary to your brokerage account
(Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard all offer this). At death, assets transfer
directly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate - Free to set up - Children
get stepped-up basis - You maintain full control while alive</p>
<h4 id="option-2-hold-in-a-revocable-trust-1">Option 2: Hold in a
Revocable Trust</h4>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Retitle the account in the trust’s name. Same
tax treatment — still gets stepped-up basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Avoids probate - Incapacity protection - Can
add conditions (age restrictions, staggered distributions)</p>
<h3 id="strategy-hold-appreciated-stock-until-death">Strategy: Hold
Appreciated Stock Until Death</h3>
<p><strong>Never sell highly appreciated stock in a taxable account if
you’re planning to leave it to your children.</strong> The step-up
erases all gains.</p>
<p>If you need to sell investments in retirement, sell from these
accounts first: 1. Stocks with <strong>losses</strong> (harvest the
loss) 2. Stocks with <strong>minimal gains</strong> 3. Traditional
IRA/401(k) (no step-up benefit anyway)</p>
<p><strong>Hold your biggest winners</strong> in the taxable brokerage
account — let the step-up work its magic.</p>
<h3 id="idaho-community-property-bonus">Idaho Community Property
Bonus</h3>
<p>Idaho is a <strong>community property state</strong>. This means
<strong>both halves</strong> of jointly-owned brokerage accounts get a
stepped-up basis at the first spouse’s death — not just the deceased
spouse’s half. This is a massive advantage over common-law states.</p>
<p><strong>Example (Community Property State like Idaho):</strong> -
Couple buys $200,000 of stock. Worth $800,000 at first spouse’s death. -
Surviving spouse’s basis: <strong>$800,000</strong> (full step-up on
both halves) - If they sell for $800,000: <strong>$0 capital
gains</strong></p>
<p><strong>Same example in a Common-Law State:</strong> - Only the
deceased’s half gets stepped up - Surviving spouse’s basis: $500,000
($100K original half + $400K stepped-up half) - If they sell for
$800,000: <strong>$300,000 in capital gains</strong> — potentially
$45K–$70K in taxes</p>
<p><strong>Idaho’s community property rules save your family potentially
tens of thousands of dollars.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="life-insurance">7. Life Insurance</h2>
<h3 id="passes-tax-free-usually">Passes Tax-Free (Usually)</h3>
<p>Life insurance death benefits are <strong>income tax-free</strong> to
your beneficiaries. A $500,000 policy pays $500,000 — no income tax.</p>
<p>However, the death benefit <strong>is included in your taxable
estate</strong> for estate tax purposes. For estates under $13.61M, this
doesn’t matter. For larger estates, an <strong>Irrevocable Life
Insurance Trust (ILIT)</strong> removes the policy from your estate.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name beneficiaries directly (avoids probate)</li>
<li><strong>Never name your estate</strong> as beneficiary — forces
probate and may create tax issues</li>
<li>Name primary AND contingent beneficiaries</li>
<li>Review after major life events</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-you-still-need-life-insurance-in-retirement">Do You Still
Need Life Insurance in Retirement?</h3>
<p>Maybe not. If your assets are sufficient to support your spouse and
pass to your children, life insurance may be unnecessary. Common reasons
to keep it: - <strong>Mortgage still outstanding</strong> — insurance
covers it - <strong>Estate liquidity</strong> — if most of your wealth
is in a home or illiquid assets, insurance provides cash for
taxes/expenses - <strong>Equalization</strong> — if one child gets the
house and another gets cash, insurance can balance it -
<strong>Charitable giving</strong> — leave insurance to charity, other
assets to children - <strong>Final expenses</strong> — small policy
($10K–$25K) for burial, funeral, and estate settlement costs</p>

<h2 id="gifting-while-alive">8. Gifting While Alive</h2>
<h3 id="annual-gift-tax-exclusion-2024">Annual Gift Tax Exclusion
(2024)</h3>
<p>You can give <strong>$18,000 per person per year</strong> (2024,
indexed for inflation) without any gift tax implications.</p>
<ul>
<li>You + spouse can give $36,000/year to each child</li>
<li>If your child is married, you can give $36,000 to them AND $36,000
to their spouse = $72,000/year per couple to each child’s family</li>
<li><strong>No tax return required</strong> for gifts under the annual
exclusion</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifetime-gift-tax-exemption">Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>Above the annual exclusion, you can give up to <strong>$13.61
million</strong> (2024) over your lifetime before any gift tax applies.
You must file a gift tax return (Form 709) but won’t actually owe tax
unless you exceed the lifetime exemption.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ This exemption is shared with your estate tax
exemption.</strong> Every dollar you gift above the annual exclusion
reduces your estate tax exemption dollar-for-dollar.</p>
<h3 id="when-gifting-makes-sense">When Gifting Makes Sense</h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Gift cash</strong> — no basis issues, no step-up lost ✅
<strong>Gift to 529 plans</strong> — up to 5 years of annual exclusion
at once ($90,000) for grandchildren’s education ✅ <strong>Pay medical
bills or tuition directly</strong> — unlimited, doesn’t count toward
gift limits (must pay the institution directly) ✅ <strong>Gift assets
expected to appreciate significantly</strong> — removes future growth
from your estate</p>
<h3 id="when-gifting-does-not-make-sense">When Gifting Does NOT Make
Sense</h3>
<p>❌ <strong>Don’t gift appreciated stock or real estate</strong> —
your children get YOUR cost basis (carryover basis), not a stepped-up
basis. They’ll owe capital gains when they sell. Let these assets pass
at death instead. ❌ <strong>Don’t gift your home</strong> — lose the
step-up, lose control, possible Medicaid issues ❌ <strong>Don’t gift
IRA/401(k) money</strong> — you can’t transfer these. You’d have to
withdraw (pay income tax), then gift the cash.</p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes-to-avoid">10. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3 id="not-updating-beneficiary-designations">1. ❌ Not Updating
Beneficiary Designations</h3>
<p>The #1 estate planning failure. Your ex-spouse is still on your
401(k). Your deceased parent is still your IRA beneficiary.
<strong>Check every account annually.</strong></p>
<h3 id="naming-your-estate-as-beneficiary">2. ❌ Naming Your Estate as
Beneficiary</h3>
<p>Forces probate. For IRAs, may accelerate the distribution timeline
and increase taxes. Always name individuals or a properly structured
trust.</p>
<h3 id="gifting-appreciated-assets-before-death">3. ❌ Gifting
Appreciated Assets Before Death</h3>
<p>You lose the stepped-up basis. Your children pay capital gains you
could have erased. Hold appreciated assets until death.</p>
<h3 id="leaving-everything-in-traditional-iras">4. ❌ Leaving Everything
in Traditional IRAs</h3>
<p>Your children will owe income tax on every dollar. Convert to Roth
during your low-income retirement years. Pay 12–22% now instead of your
kids paying 24–35% later.</p>
<h3 id="not-having-a-trust-for-the-home">5. ❌ Not Having a Trust for
the Home</h3>
<p>Without a trust or TOD deed, your home goes through probate — public,
slow, expensive. Easy to avoid.</p>
<h3 id="treating-all-children-equally-when-tax-situations-differ">6. ❌
Treating All Children Equally When Tax Situations Differ</h3>
<p>If one child earns $200K and another earns $50K, giving them equal
shares of a traditional IRA means the higher earner pays much more in
taxes. Consider giving the higher earner more brokerage (stepped-up
basis) and the lower earner more IRA (taxed at their lower rate).</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-the-10-year-rule-on-inherited-iras">7. ❌ Ignoring the
10-Year Rule on Inherited IRAs</h3>
<p>Your children may not realize they have only 10 years to withdraw. A
large balance withdrawn in year 10 could push them into the 32–37% tax
bracket. Plan a withdrawal strategy.</p>
<h3 id="not-considering-roth-conversions">8. ❌ Not Considering Roth
Conversions</h3>
<p>Every dollar you convert from traditional to Roth is a dollar your
children receive tax-free. Early retirement (ages 60–67) is the golden
window for conversions — your income is low, your tax rate is low.</p>
<h3 id="forgetting-about-digital-assets">9. ❌ Forgetting About Digital
Assets</h3>
<p>Crypto, online accounts, domain names, digital businesses. Document
access and include in your estate plan.</p>
<h3 id="diy-without-professional-review">10. ❌ DIY Without Professional
Review</h3>
<p>Online tools are fine for simple situations, but the tax optimization
of passing assets — especially IRAs — to children can save tens of
thousands. A one-time consultation ($500–$1,500) with an estate planning
attorney or tax-focused financial planner pays for itself many times
over.</p>

<h3 id="the-optimal-inheritance-tax-strategy">The Optimal Inheritance
Tax Strategy</h3>
<pre><code>SPEND in retirement:     Traditional IRA/401(k) → Convert remainder to Roth
HOLD until death:        Appreciated brokerage stock → Kids get stepped-up basis
LEAVE to kids:           Roth IRA (tax-free) + Brokerage (stepped-up) + Home (stepped-up)
LEAVE to charity:        Traditional IRA (charity pays no tax on it)</code></pre>
<p>This structure ensures your children pay the <strong>minimum possible
tax</strong> on their inheritance.</p>
