<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>Oregon is Idaho’s polar opposite in many ways — lush rainforests, a
dramatic Pacific coastline, volcanic peaks, high desert, and river
gorges. From Star, you cross into eastern Oregon quickly and enter a
landscape of open rangeland, painted hills, and canyon country before
climbing into the Cascades or dropping to the coast.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-oregon-amazing-for-camping">What Makes Oregon Amazing
for Camping</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The entire Oregon coast is public</strong> — no private
beaches. 363 miles of coastline, all accessible.</li>
<li>Incredible diversity: desert, forest, mountains, coast, volcanic
landscapes — all in one state</li>
<li>Extensive national forest and BLM land for free dispersed
camping</li>
<li>World-class hiking, fishing, and scenic drives</li>

Cascades)</li>

water so blue it doesn’t look real</li>

<h2 id="ft-rv-tips-for-oregon">8. 18ft RV Tips for Oregon</h2>
<h3 id="road-conditions">Road Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I-84 (Star → Oregon):</strong> Interstate, perfect
condition. Your gateway to eastern Oregon.</li>
<li><strong>Hwy 26 (John Day / Painted Hills):</strong> Well-maintained
two-lane highway. Easy.</li>
<li><strong>Hwy 20 (Burns / Bend):</strong> Long, straight, through high
desert. Easy but remote — fuel up when you can.</li>
<li><strong>Hwy 97 (Central Oregon):</strong> Major north-south route.
Good condition.</li>
<li><strong>Steens Mountain Loop Road:</strong> Gravel/dirt above Fish
Lake. Narrow in places. <strong>Doable in 18ft but go slow.</strong>
Check opening date (usually July).</li>
<li><strong>Hat Point Road (Hells Canyon):</strong> Narrow, winding,
steep gravel. Passable but nerve-wracking in 18ft. Scout conditions
first.</li>
<li><strong>Cascade forest roads:</strong> Variable — some are smooth
gravel, others are rough. Check USFS conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Coast (Hwy 101):</strong> Paved but winding with some tight
turns through towns. 18ft is fine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dump-stations">Dump Stations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontario, OR:</strong> Travel centers on I-84</li>
<li><strong>Baker City:</strong> Oregon Trail Interpretive Center area,
local RV park</li>
<li><strong>Burns:</strong> Burns RV Park / Safeway area</li>
<li><strong>Bend:</strong> Tumalo State Park, Scandia RV Park, Walmart
area</li>
<li><strong>La Grande:</strong> Hot Lake RV Resort area</li>
<li><strong>Joseph:</strong> Wallowa Lake State Park (campers)</li>
<li><strong>Coast towns:</strong> Most state parks have dump stations
(even for non-campers, small fee)</li>
<li><strong>Sanidumps app</strong> — maps every dump station</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="water-fill-up">Water Fill-Up</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas stations in small towns</strong> — ask politely, most
will let you fill up</li>
<li><strong>State park campgrounds</strong> — often have water spigots
accessible</li>
<li><strong>Bend:</strong> Multiple options</li>
<li><strong>Fill up in Boise/Star</strong> before crossing into eastern
Oregon — towns are few and far between</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="propane-refill">Propane Refill</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontario:</strong> Multiple stations near I-84</li>
<li><strong>Baker City:</strong> Local hardware/farm stores</li>
<li><strong>Burns:</strong> Gas stations</li>
<li><strong>Bend:</strong> U-Haul, Suburban Propane, local shops</li>
<li><strong>La Grande:</strong> Local suppliers</li>
<li><strong>Eastern Oregon tip:</strong> Fill up before heading into the
backcountry. Propane availability is sparse between towns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuel-stops-plan-ahead">Fuel Stops — Plan Ahead!</h3>
<p><strong>⚠️ Eastern Oregon is REMOTE.</strong> Gas stations can be
60–100 miles apart.</p>
<p>Key fuel stops: - Ontario → Baker City (75 mi) - Baker City → John
Day (80 mi) - John Day → Burns (70 mi) - Burns → Bend (130 mi —
<strong>fill up in Burns!</strong>) - Burns → Frenchglen (60 mi —
<strong>Frenchglen has very limited fuel</strong>)</p>
<h3 id="oregon-specific-rules">Oregon-Specific Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No self-serve gas</strong> — Oregon requires attendants to
pump your gas (partially relaxed for rural counties in 2023, but most
stations still pump for you)</li>
<li><strong>No sales tax</strong> — everything you buy in Oregon is
tax-free (stock up!)</li>
<li><strong>Northwest Forest Pass</strong> — required for parking at
many USFS trailheads ($5/day or $30/year). Buy at ranger stations or
REI.</li>
<li><strong>Fire restrictions</strong> — Oregon is strict. Check
oregonsmoke.org and USFS alerts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wildlife">Wildlife</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black bears:</strong> Central and western Oregon. Same
precautions as Idaho.</li>
<li><strong>Cougars:</strong> Present statewide. Unlikely encounter but
be aware hiking.</li>
<li><strong>Rattlesnakes:</strong> Eastern Oregon, especially in
desert/canyon areas. Watch where you step.</li>
<li><strong>Ticks:</strong> Spring through mid-summer in grassland/brush
areas. Check after hiking.</li>
<li><strong>No grizzly bears</strong> in Oregon.</li>
</ul>
