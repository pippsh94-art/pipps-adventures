<h2 id="know-your-number">1. Know Your Number</h2>
<h3 id="the-4-rule-and-why-its-a-starting-point">The 4% Rule (and Why
It’s a Starting Point)</h3>
<p>The most widely cited retirement rule of thumb is the “4% rule,”
based on the 1994 Trinity Study. The idea: if you withdraw 4% of your
portfolio in year one and adjust for inflation each year after, your
money has historically lasted 30 years about 95% of the time. To find
your target number, take your expected annual spending and multiply by
25. Spending $80,000/year? You need $2,000,000. Spending $120,000? You
need $3,000,000.</p>
<p>But retiring at 60 means you may need 30–35+ years of income, which
stretches the original study’s assumptions. Many financial planners
recommend a more conservative 3.5% withdrawal rate for early retirees,
which means multiplying annual spending by ~28–30x instead of 25x. At
$80K/year spending, that bumps your target to $2.3–2.4M.</p>
<h3 id="spending-scenarios">Spending Scenarios</h3>
<p>Think about which lifestyle tier fits you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lean FIRE ($40,000/year):</strong> Minimal, frugal
lifestyle. Need ~$1.0–1.2M. Tight but doable — requires low housing
costs (paid-off home or cheap area), minimal travel, and good
health.</li>
<li><strong>Comfortable FIRE ($80,000/year):</strong> Covers a solid
middle-class lifestyle with travel, hobbies, dining out, and a buffer.
Need ~$2.0–2.4M. This is the sweet spot most people target.</li>
<li><strong>Fat FIRE ($120,000+/year):</strong> Premium lifestyle —
nicer travel, new cars, generous gifting, luxury hobbies. Need
$3.0–3.6M+.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monte-carlo-simulations">Monte Carlo Simulations</h3>
<p>Don’t rely solely on the 4% rule. Use Monte Carlo simulation tools
(available free at FIRECalc.com, cFIREsim, or through advisors) that run
your specific scenario through thousands of possible market histories.
They give you a probability of success — aim for 90%+ across 35 years.
These tools let you model variable spending, Social Security start
dates, pensions, and one-time expenses like a new roof or car.</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-for-inflation">Adjusting for Inflation</h3>
<p>A dollar today won’t buy a dollar’s worth of goods in 20 years. At 3%
average inflation, $80K in today’s dollars becomes ~$144K in 20 years.
Your investments need to outpace inflation, which is why keeping a
significant equity allocation matters even in retirement. When
calculating your number, use <strong>today’s dollars</strong> for
simplicity but make sure your withdrawal strategy adjusts for inflation
annually.</p>

<h3 id="the-age-milestones-you-must-know">The Age Milestones You Must
Know</h3>
<p>Retiring at 60 means navigating a minefield of age-gated
benefits:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At 60, you’re past 59½ so you can access retirement accounts
penalty-free. But you’re still 2 years from the earliest Social Security
and 5 years from Medicare. This 60–65 window is the most expensive and
complex bridge to plan for.</p>
<h3 id="rule-of-55-and-72t-sepp">Rule of 55 and 72(t) SEPP</h3>
<p>If you leave your employer at age 55 or later, the <strong>Rule of
55</strong> lets you withdraw from that specific employer’s 401(k)
penalty-free (not IRAs, not old 401(k)s — only the plan of the employer
you separated from). This is huge if you retire between 55–59½.</p>
<p>If you need IRA money before 59½, <strong>72(t) Substantially Equal
Periodic Payments (SEPP)</strong> allow penalty-free withdrawals based
on your life expectancy. But beware: once you start, you must continue
for 5 years or until 59½ (whichever is later), and if you modify the
payments, you owe all the penalties retroactively. It’s rigid but useful
in a pinch.</p>
<h3 id="the-roth-contribution-ladder">The Roth Contribution Ladder</h3>
<p>This is the early retiree’s secret weapon. You can withdraw
<strong>Roth IRA contributions</strong> (not earnings) at any time, any
age, tax- and penalty-free. If you’ve been contributing for years, you
may have a nice pool of contributions to draw from. Additionally, Roth
conversions become accessible after a 5-year seasoning period — so if
you start converting at 55, that money is available at 60.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-to-keep-liquid">How Much to Keep Liquid</h3>
<p>Keep <strong>2–5 years of living expenses</strong> in easily
accessible accounts: high-yield savings, money market funds, short-term
bond funds, or a taxable brokerage account. This serves two purposes:
(1) it covers the bridge to Social Security and Medicare, and (2) it
protects you from selling stocks during a downturn in early retirement
(sequence of returns risk). At $80K/year spending, that’s $160K–$400K in
accessible, low-volatility assets.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="healthcare-plan">3. Healthcare Plan</h2>
<h3 id="aca-marketplace-your-best-option-at-60">ACA Marketplace (Your
Best Option at 60)</h3>
<p>For most early retirees, the <strong>Affordable Care Act (ACA)
marketplace</strong> is the go-to for health insurance from 60 to 65.
Premium subsidies are based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income
(MAGI). In 2025, a household of two earning ~$40,000–$60,000 MAGI can
qualify for significant subsidies that bring Silver plan premiums down
to $200–$500/month. The key strategy: <strong>control your MAGI</strong>
through careful Roth conversions and capital gains harvesting to stay in
the subsidy sweet spot.</p>
<p>The enhanced ACA subsidies (no cliff, capped at 8.5% of income) were
extended through 2025 and may be extended further. Without subsidies, a
60-year-old couple can face premiums of $1,500–$2,500/month for a Silver
plan. Managing your taxable income is literally worth thousands per
month.</p>
<h3 id="cobra-and-other-options">COBRA and Other Options</h3>
<p><strong>COBRA</strong> lets you keep your employer’s health plan for
up to 18 months after leaving, but you pay the full premium (employer +
employee share) plus a 2% admin fee. This typically runs $600–$800/month
for an individual or $1,500–$2,000+ for a family. It’s expensive but can
be useful for a short bridge — especially if you have ongoing treatment
with specific providers.</p>
<p><strong>Health sharing ministries</strong> (Medi-Share, Christian
Healthcare Ministries, etc.) are cheaper ($200–$500/month) but are
<strong>not insurance</strong>. They don’t have to cover pre-existing
conditions, can deny claims, and aren’t regulated like insurance. Use
with extreme caution.</p>
<h3 id="dental-vision-and-long-term-care">Dental, Vision, and Long-Term
Care</h3>
<p>Medicare doesn’t cover dental or vision (mostly). Budget
$50–$150/month for supplemental dental/vision coverage, or self-insure
with savings. Dental costs can spike — a single crown runs
$1,000–$2,000, implants $3,000–$5,000.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term care (LTC) insurance</strong> is worth considering
in your mid-to-late 50s. The average cost of a nursing home is
$95,000–$110,000/year; assisted living runs $55,000–$65,000/year. LTC
premiums get dramatically more expensive with age and health issues. A
couple buying policies at 55–60 might pay $2,000–$5,000/year combined.
Hybrid life/LTC policies are increasingly popular as they guarantee some
benefit even if you never need care.</p>

<p><strong>SECURE 2.0 Super Catch-Up:</strong> Starting 2025, those aged
60–63 can contribute an additional $11,250 to their 401(k) instead of
the standard $7,500 catch-up — for a total of $34,750/year. This is a
massive opportunity if you’re in that window.</p>
<h3 id="mega-backdoor-roth">Mega Backdoor Roth</h3>
<p>If your employer’s 401(k) plan allows after-tax contributions and
in-service distributions/rollovers, you can contribute up to the total
415(c) limit ($70,000 in 2025, including employer match) and convert the
after-tax portion to Roth. This can add $30,000–$40,000+ per year to
your Roth balance. Check with your plan administrator — not all plans
allow this, but if yours does, it’s the single most powerful savings
accelerator available.</p>
<h3 id="employer-match-and-spousal-ira">Employer Match and Spousal
IRA</h3>
<p>Never leave free money on the table. If your employer matches 401(k)
contributions, that’s an instant 50–100% return. At minimum, contribute
enough to get the full match.</p>
<p>If you have a non-working or lower-earning spouse, a <strong>spousal
IRA</strong> lets them contribute up to $7,000 + $1,000 catch-up ($8,000
total) even with no earned income, as long as the working spouse has
enough earned income to cover both contributions. That’s an extra
$8,000/year in tax-advantaged savings.</p>
<h3 id="hsa-the-triple-tax-advantage">HSA: The Triple-Tax Advantage</h3>
<p>The Health Savings Account is the most tax-efficient account in
existence: contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and
withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. After age 65,
you can withdraw for any purpose (taxed as income, like a traditional
IRA, but no penalty). Strategy: pay medical expenses out of pocket now,
save receipts, and let the HSA grow. Withdraw decades later tax-free for
those old receipts.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="eliminate-debt-before-60">5. Eliminate Debt Before 60</h2>
<h3 id="the-mortgage-payoff-debate">The Mortgage Payoff Debate</h3>
<p>This is the most debated topic in retirement planning. The math says:
if your mortgage rate is 3–4% and the stock market averages 7–10%,
you’re better off investing. But retirement isn’t just math — it’s
psychology. A paid-off home means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your baseline monthly expenses drop dramatically
($1,500–$3,000/month savings is common)</li>
<li>You need a smaller portfolio (lower withdrawal rate)</li>
<li>You have more flexibility if markets crash</li>
<li><strong>Peace of mind is worth something</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your mortgage rate is above 5–6%, paying it off is almost always
the right call. Below 4%, it’s a personal decision. One middle ground:
pay off the mortgage the year you retire, using a lump sum from taxable
accounts.</p>
<h3 id="which-debts-to-kill-first">Which Debts to Kill First</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>debt avalanche</strong> method (highest interest rate
first) for maximum savings, or the <strong>debt snowball</strong>
(smallest balance first) for psychological momentum. In practice:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Credit cards (15–25% APR)</strong> — eliminate immediately,
no debate</li>
<li><strong>Car loans (5–8%)</strong> — pay off before retirement</li>
<li><strong>Student loans (4–7%)</strong> — pay off or ensure manageable
payments</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage (3–7%)</strong> — strategic decision (see
above)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="impact-on-withdrawal-rates">Impact on Withdrawal Rates</h3>
<p>Going into retirement debt-free can reduce your required annual
spending by 20–40%. If your mortgage payment is $2,000/month
($24,000/year), eliminating it means you need $24,000 less from your
portfolio annually. Using the 4% rule, that’s $600,000 less you need
saved. Debt-free retirement is the single biggest lever most people have
to make early retirement viable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="diversify-income-streams">6. Diversify Income Streams</h2>
<h3 id="social-security-optimization">Social Security Optimization</h3>
<p>Social Security is likely your largest single retirement asset. Key
strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay if possible:</strong> Each year you delay past 62
increases your benefit by ~6.7%/year until 67 (full retirement age),
then 8%/year until 70. A $2,000/month benefit at 62 becomes ~$2,860 at
67 and ~$3,550 at 70 — a 77% increase.</li>
<li><strong>Breakeven analysis:</strong> Delaying from 62 to 67 breaks
even around age 78–80. Delaying to 70 breaks even around 80–82. If you
expect to live past 85, delaying is almost always worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Spousal benefits:</strong> A lower-earning spouse can claim
up to 50% of the higher earner’s benefit at full retirement age.
Coordinate claiming strategies as a couple.</li>
<li><strong>Survivor benefits:</strong> The surviving spouse gets the
higher of the two benefits. This is a huge reason for the higher earner
to delay — it protects the surviving spouse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dividend-and-investment-income">Dividend and Investment
Income</h3>
<p>Building a portfolio that generates $20,000–$40,000/year in dividends
and interest can significantly reduce the need to sell shares. A
diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks and bond funds yielding
2.5–3.5% on $1M generates $25,000–$35,000/year. Focus on dividend growth
stocks (companies that raise dividends annually) rather than chasing
high yields, which often signal risk.</p>
<h3 id="part-time-work-and-rental-income">Part-Time Work and Rental
Income</h3>
<p>Even modest part-time income of $15,000–$25,000/year in early
retirement has an outsized impact. Research shows that earning $20K/year
for the first 5 years of retirement can improve portfolio survival by
10–15 percentage points. Consulting, freelancing, or part-time work you
enjoy can bridge the gap and keep you socially engaged.</p>
<p>Rental income can be excellent passive income but requires capital,
management effort, and carries risk (vacancies, repairs, bad tenants).
If you already own rental property, great. Buying investment property
specifically for retirement income requires careful analysis of
cash-on-cash returns, typically targeting 6–10% net.</p>
<h3 id="annuities-proceed-with-caution">Annuities: Proceed with
Caution</h3>
<p>A <strong>Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)</strong> can
provide guaranteed lifetime income, essentially creating your own
pension. At 60, a $200,000 SPIA might generate ~$900–$1,100/month for
life. Pros: guaranteed income floor, longevity protection, peace of
mind. Cons: you give up the principal, low returns vs. market, limited
inflation protection, and if you die early, the money may be gone.
Consider annuitizing only 20–30% of your portfolio — enough for a
baseline income floor, not so much that you sacrifice growth.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="tax-strategy">7. Tax Strategy</h2>
<h3 id="roth-conversion-ladder-step-by-step">Roth Conversion Ladder
(Step by Step)</h3>
<p>This is one of the most powerful tools for early retirees:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Year 1 (age 60):</strong> You retire. Your income drops to
near zero. Convert $50,000–$80,000 from traditional IRA to Roth IRA,
filling up the 12% or 22% tax bracket.</li>
<li><strong>Pay taxes</strong> on the conversion from taxable accounts
or savings — not from the IRA itself.</li>
<li><strong>Years 2–5:</strong> Repeat annual conversions, staying
within your target tax bracket.</li>
<li><strong>Year 6+:</strong> The Year 1 conversion has now “seasoned”
for 5 years and can be withdrawn from the Roth completely tax- and
penalty-free.</li>
<li><strong>Meanwhile:</strong> Live off taxable brokerage accounts,
Roth contributions, and savings during the 5-year seasoning period.</li>
</ol>
<p>This effectively moves money from a tax-deferred account to a
tax-free account at a low tax rate, saving you potentially hundreds of
thousands in taxes over your lifetime.</p>
<h3 id="tax-bracket-optimization">Tax Bracket Optimization</h3>
<p>In 2025, the federal tax brackets for married filing jointly are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10%:</strong> $0–$23,850</li>
<li><strong>12%:</strong> $23,851–$96,950</li>
<li><strong>22%:</strong> $96,951–$206,700</li>
<li><strong>24%:</strong> $206,701–$394,600</li>
</ul>
<p>With the standard deduction of ~$32,300 (MFJ, 65+), a retired couple
can have ~$129,250 in gross income and stay in the 22% bracket. Fill up
the lower brackets each year with Roth conversions — don’t leave cheap
tax space on the table.</p>
<h3 id="capital-gains-harvesting">Capital Gains Harvesting</h3>
<p>In 2025, married couples filing jointly pay <strong>0% capital gains
tax</strong> on up to ~$94,050 in taxable income (including long-term
capital gains). In early retirement with low ordinary income, you can
strategically sell appreciated investments, pay zero capital gains tax,
and reset your cost basis. This is free money — do it every year your
income is low enough.</p>
<h3 id="state-tax-considerations">State Tax Considerations</h3>
<p>States vary wildly. <strong>Idaho has a state income tax</strong>
(5.695% flat rate as of 2023+). States with no income tax include
Nevada, Wyoming, Texas, Florida, Washington, Tennessee, and South
Dakota. If you’re flexible on location, moving to a no-income-tax state
can save $5,000–$20,000+/year depending on your income level. Some
states also exempt Social Security or pension income from state tax.</p>
<h3 id="rmds-and-qcds">RMDs and QCDs</h3>
<p>Under SECURE 2.0, <strong>Required Minimum Distributions
(RMDs)</strong> start at age 73 (75 for those born 1960+). At that
point, the IRS forces you to withdraw from traditional accounts whether
you need the money or not. Roth conversions in your 60s reduce future
RMDs. After age 70½, <strong>Qualified Charitable Distributions
(QCDs)</strong> let you donate up to $105,000/year directly from your
IRA to charity — it counts toward your RMD but isn’t included in taxable
income. If you’re charitably inclined, this is extremely
tax-efficient.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="plan-for-longevity">8. Plan for Longevity</h2>
<h3 id="asset-allocation-glide-paths">Asset Allocation Glide Paths</h3>
<p>At 60, you need your money to last 30–35+ years. Going too
conservative too early is one of the biggest mistakes retirees make. A
common starting allocation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age 60:</strong> 55–65% stocks / 35–45% bonds</li>
<li><strong>Age 70:</strong> 45–55% stocks / 45–55% bonds</li>
<li><strong>Age 80+:</strong> 35–45% stocks / 55–65% bonds</li>
</ul>
<p>Some research (Wade Pfau, Michael Kitces) actually suggests a
<strong>rising equity glide path</strong> — starting with ~30% stocks
and increasing to 60–70% over time — because it mitigates sequence of
returns risk. The key: never go below 30% stocks, even in your 80s. You
need growth to beat inflation.</p>
<h3 id="the-bucket-strategy">The Bucket Strategy</h3>
<p>Organize your portfolio into three “buckets”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bucket 1 (1–2 years):</strong> Cash, high-yield savings,
money market. Covers near-term expenses. You draw from here monthly.
Refill from Bucket 2.</li>
<li><strong>Bucket 2 (3–7 years):</strong> Short-to-intermediate bonds,
bond funds, CDs. Provides stability and income. Refill Bucket 1
periodically.</li>
<li><strong>Bucket 3 (8+ years):</strong> Stock index funds, growth
investments. This is your long-term engine. You don’t touch this during
downturns — let it recover and grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure means you never have to sell stocks in a crash. Your
1–2 years of cash buys time for markets to recover.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-of-returns-risk">Sequence of Returns Risk</h3>
<p>The <strong>biggest threat</strong> to early retirees isn’t average
returns — it’s bad returns in the first 5 years. A 30% market drop in
year 1 of retirement, combined with withdrawals, can permanently impair
your portfolio even if markets recover. Mitigation strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep 2+ years in cash/bonds (bucket strategy)</li>
<li>Reduce spending temporarily in down markets (flexible withdrawal
rules)</li>
<li>Have income from other sources (Social Security, part-time work,
rental income)</li>
<li>Consider a small SPIA for baseline income</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inflation-protection">Inflation Protection</h3>
<p>Inflation is the silent killer of retirement plans. Tools to fight
it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities):</strong>
Principal adjusts with CPI. Yields are low but guaranteed to keep pace
with inflation. Allocate 10–20% of bonds to TIPS.</li>
<li><strong>I-Bonds:</strong> Currently offering competitive rates.
$10,000/year purchase limit per person ($20K for a couple). Great for
the cash bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Historically the best long-term inflation
hedge. Companies raise prices and earnings with inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Social Security:</strong> Includes annual COLA adjustments —
another reason to delay claiming for a higher base benefit.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="test-drive-it">9. Test Drive It</h2>
<h3 id="live-on-your-retirement-budget">Live on Your Retirement
Budget</h3>
<p>Before you pull the trigger, <strong>live on your projected
retirement budget for 6–12 months</strong> while still working. If you
plan to spend $80K/year in retirement ($6,667/month), limit yourself to
that now. Bank everything extra. This reveals hidden expenses, tests
your discipline, and shows whether the number actually works in
practice. Most people discover they either spend more than expected
(eating out, subscriptions, home maintenance) or have room to spare.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-tools">Tracking Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>YNAB (You Need A Budget):</strong> Best for active budgeting
and expense tracking ($99/year)</li>
<li><strong>Empower (formerly Personal Capital):</strong> Best free tool
for tracking investments, net worth, and retirement projections</li>
<li><strong>FIRECalc / cFIREsim:</strong> Free Monte Carlo retirement
simulators</li>
<li><strong>Social Security.gov:</strong> Create an account to see your
projected benefits</li>
<li><strong>Boldin (formerly NewRetirement):</strong> Detailed
retirement planning tool ($120/year, worth it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="psychological-preparation">Psychological Preparation</h3>
<p>This is the part most people skip, and it matters enormously:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity beyond work:</strong> If your identity is wrapped
up in your career, retirement can trigger a real identity crisis. Start
building non-work identity now — hobbies, community, volunteering,
relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Daily structure:</strong> Unstructured days sound great for
a month. After that, many retirees feel lost. Have a plan: morning
routine, projects, exercise, social activities.</li>
<li><strong>Social connections:</strong> Work provides built-in social
interaction. Without it, isolation is a real risk. Join clubs,
volunteer, take classes, maintain friendships actively.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Studies consistently show that retirees
with a sense of purpose live longer and are happier. This doesn’t have
to be grand — gardening, mentoring, building things, learning new skills
all count.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-most-people-get-wrong">What Most People Get Wrong</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Underestimating healthcare costs:</strong> The biggest gap
between “I’ll be fine” and reality. Budget more than you think.</li>
<li><strong>Overestimating Social Security:</strong> It replaces about
40% of pre-retirement income for average earners. It’s a supplement, not
a plan.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring inflation:</strong> $80K/year at 60 needs to be
$120K+ at 75 to maintain the same lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Not testing the plan:</strong> Spreadsheets aren’t reality.
Live it before you commit.</li>
<li><strong>Retiring FROM something instead of TO something:</strong>
The happiest retirees have a clear vision of what they want to do, not
just what they want to escape.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting about taxes:</strong> A $2M portfolio isn’t $2M
if it’s all in a traditional IRA — the IRS owns 20–30% of it.</li>
