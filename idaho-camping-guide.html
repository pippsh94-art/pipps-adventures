<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>Idaho is one of the most underrated camping states in the country.
Over 60% of the state is public land — national forests, BLM, and
wilderness areas — meaning you have virtually unlimited places to camp,
many of them free. The Gem State offers everything from alpine lakes at
8,000+ feet to desert canyons, wild rivers, and natural hot springs you
can soak in under the stars.</p>
<h3 id="summer-weather-juneseptember">Summer Weather
(June–September)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boise/Star area (2,700 ft):</strong> Hot — highs of 85–100°F
in July/August. You’ll want to head to higher elevations.</li>
<li><strong>Mountains (5,000–7,000 ft):</strong> Perfect — highs of
70–85°F, lows of 40–55°F. Ideal camping weather.</li>
<li><strong>High mountains (7,000+ ft):</strong> Cool — highs of
60–75°F, lows of 30–45°F. Bring layers.</li>
<li><strong>Monsoon season:</strong> Late July–August can bring
afternoon thunderstorms in the mountains. They usually clear by
evening.</li>
<li><strong>Fire season:</strong> August–September. Fire restrictions
are common — check before you go. Some years are worse than others for
smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-an-18ft-rig-is-perfect-for-idaho">Why an 18ft Rig is Perfect
for Idaho</h3>
<p>Most Idaho campgrounds were built for smaller rigs. Many national
forest sites have tight turns, narrow roads, and short pads. Your
18-footer will fit places that 30+ foot rigs can’t touch. This opens up
some of the best, most remote spots in the state.</p>

<h2 id="boondocking-dispersed-camping">4. Boondocking / Dispersed
Camping</h2>
<h3 id="what-you-need-to-know">What You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Idaho is a boondocker’s paradise. National Forest and BLM land allow
free dispersed camping almost everywhere unless posted otherwise.
General rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>14-day stay limit</strong> in one spot (then move at least 5
miles)</li>
<li><strong>No fee</strong> in most dispersed areas</li>
<li><strong>Pack in, pack out</strong> — no trash service</li>
<li><strong>Camp in previously used sites</strong> when possible (look
for fire rings, cleared areas)</li>
<li><strong>Stay on established roads and pull-offs</strong> — don’t
create new sites</li>
<li><strong>Check fire restrictions</strong> before building any
campfire — Idaho issues Stage 1–3 restrictions that can prohibit fires
entirely</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-dispersed-camping-areas">Best Dispersed Camping Areas</h3>
<p><strong>Boise National Forest (closest to Star)</strong> -
<strong>Grimes Creek Road</strong> (east of Horseshoe Bend): Multiple
pulloffs and dispersed sites along the creek. 45 min–1.5 hours from
Star. Mix of dirt and gravel roads, most fine for 18ft. -
<strong>Wilderness Ranch / Beaver Creek</strong> (north of Boise):
Forest roads with numerous dispersed sites. 1–1.5 hours. -
<strong>Banks-Lowman Road side roads:</strong> Turn off onto any USFS
road and you’ll find spots. Many are along creeks.</p>
<p><strong>Sawtooth National Forest</strong> - <strong>Smiley Creek
area</strong> (south of Stanley): Wide open valley with dispersed sites
along the creek. Easy access, flat. - <strong>Galena Summit
area:</strong> Stunning high-elevation dispersed camping with Sawtooth
views. - <strong>East Fork Wood River</strong> (near Ketchum): Numerous
pulloffs along the river.</p>
<p><strong>Payette National Forest</strong> - <strong>Warren Wagon
Road</strong> (north of McCall): Remote, gorgeous. Some rougher roads —
scout first. - <strong>Lick Creek Road</strong> (east of McCall): Good
dispersed options with mountain views.</p>
<p><strong>BLM Land</strong> - <strong>Boise Foothills / Orchard
area:</strong> Closest BLM options but lower desert — hot in summer. -
<strong>Salmon River corridor BLM:</strong> Various pulloffs along the
river between Stanley and Challis.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-18ft-rig-dispersed-camping">Tips for 18ft Rig Dispersed
Camping</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scout on Google Maps satellite view</strong> before
committing to a dirt road</li>
<li><strong>Download offline maps</strong> (iOverlander, FreeRoam,
Campendium apps are great for finding dispersed sites)</li>
<li><strong>Watch for soft shoulders</strong> — Idaho forest roads can
have soft edges where your rig can sink</li>
<li><strong>Back-in sites are more common</strong> than pull-throughs in
dispersed areas</li>
<li><strong>Avoid roads rated “high clearance only”</strong> — your 18ft
should be fine on most maintained forest roads, but don’t push it on
unmaintained 4x4 routes</li>
<li><strong>Arrive by early afternoon</strong> on weekends — popular
free spots fill up by Friday evening in summer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ft-rv-tips-for-idaho">7. 18ft RV Tips for Idaho</h2>
<h3 id="road-conditions">Road Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paved highways</strong> (21, 55, 75): All fine, well
maintained. Some winding mountain passes.</li>
<li><strong>Maintained forest roads:</strong> Usually gravel/dirt,
passable in any RV. Watch for washboard and potholes after spring thaw
(June).</li>
<li><strong>Unmaintained forest roads:</strong> Scout first. Some are
rough — deep ruts, rocks, narrow with no turnarounds. Your 18ft can
handle more than a 30-footer, but know your clearance.</li>
<li><strong>Specific cautions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Road to Grandjean: Narrow, dirt, 25-30 min of rough road. Doable in
18ft but go slow.</li>
<li>Burgdorf road: Passable but slow (30 mph dirt road for 30 min)</li>
<li>Atlanta road: Long, rough. Not recommended for RVs unless
well-maintained that year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dump-stations">Dump Stations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boise:</strong> Multiple — Walmart on Eagle Rd, Albertsons
BSU area, Flying J on Garrity</li>
<li><strong>McCall:</strong> City dump station near the airport
($5–10)</li>
<li><strong>Stanley:</strong> Community dump station on Hwy 75</li>
<li><strong>Cascade:</strong> Valley County dump station</li>
<li><strong>Ketchum/Hailey:</strong> Wood River dump stations</li>
<li><strong>Lowman:</strong> Gas station may have dump (call ahead)</li>
<li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Download the Sanidumps app — it maps every
dump station in Idaho</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="water-fill-up">Water Fill-Up</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas stations</strong> in small towns (Lowman, Stanley,
Cascade, McCall) usually let you fill up — ask first</li>
<li><strong>USFS campgrounds</strong> with water spigots — bring a hose
and fill your tank</li>
<li><strong>Boise:</strong> Fill up at home before heading out</li>
<li><strong>Gravity-fed mountain spring taps</strong> exist along some
highways — look for “spring water” signs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="propane-refill">Propane Refill</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Star/Boise area:</strong> Multiple — U-Haul, Tractor Supply,
AmeriGas</li>
<li><strong>McCall:</strong> McCall Building Supply, local hardware
stores</li>
<li><strong>Cascade:</strong> Gas stations</li>
<li><strong>Stanley:</strong> Limited — fill up in Boise or Ketchum</li>
<li><strong>Ketchum/Hailey:</strong> Hailey has propane fill
stations</li>

<h3 id="bear-country">Bear Country</h3>
<ul>
<li>Central Idaho is <strong>black bear country</strong> (no grizzlies
in most camping areas, though they’re expanding south from the
Selway-Bitterroot)</li>
<li>Store food in your RV with doors/windows closed — don’t leave
coolers outside</li>
<li>Keep a clean camp — trash attracts bears</li>
<li>Bear spray is cheap insurance ($30–50) — carry it hiking</li>
<li>Dog food and bird seed are major attractants — keep them sealed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fire-restrictions">Fire Restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check before every trip:</strong> Idaho Fire Info
(idahofireinfo.com) or call the local Ranger District</li>
<li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> No campfires outside of developed
campgrounds with metal fire rings. Camp stoves OK.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> No campfires at all, including developed
campgrounds. Camp stoves may be restricted.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Area closure — no entry.</li>
<li><strong>Typical timing:</strong> Restrictions start mid-July and can
last through September</li>
<li><strong>Bring a camp stove regardless</strong> — don’t rely on
campfires for cooking in Idaho summer</li>
