<h2 id="putting-your-home-in-a-trust">1. Putting Your Home in a
Trust</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-living-trust">What Is a Living Trust?</h3>
<p>A <strong>revocable living trust</strong> is a legal entity you
create while alive. You transfer ownership of your assets (home, bank
accounts, investments) into the trust. You remain the trustee
(controller) and beneficiary while alive — nothing changes day-to-day.
But when you pass away, the trust assets transfer to your named
beneficiaries <strong>without going through probate</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="why-put-your-home-in-a-trust">Why Put Your Home in a Trust?</h3>
<p><strong>Avoid Probate</strong> - Probate is the court process of
distributing assets after death. It’s public, slow (6–18 months in many
states), and expensive (3–7% of estate value in legal/court fees). - In
<strong>Idaho</strong>, probate is relatively straightforward compared
to California or New York, but it still takes time, costs money, and
becomes public record. - A home in a trust passes directly to
beneficiaries — no court, no delay, no public record.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong> - Probate is <strong>public record</strong>
— anyone can see what you owned and who got it. A trust is private.
Nobody outside the trust knows what’s in it or who inherits.</p>
<p><strong>Incapacity Planning</strong> - If you become incapacitated
(stroke, dementia, accident), a trust with a named <strong>successor
trustee</strong> allows that person to manage the property immediately —
no court proceeding needed. Without a trust, your family may need a
<strong>conservatorship</strong> (expensive, slow,
court-supervised).</p>
<p><strong>Continuity for Your Family</strong> - Your home passes to
beneficiaries immediately upon death. No frozen assets, no waiting for
court approval. They can live in it, sell it, or rent it right away.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Creditor Protection (Irrevocable Trust)</strong> -
A <strong>revocable</strong> trust does NOT protect from creditors while
you’re alive (because you still control it). - An
<strong>irrevocable</strong> trust CAN protect assets from creditors,
lawsuits, and even Medicaid spend-down — but you give up control. This
is a more advanced strategy, usually done with an estate attorney.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-doesnt-do">What It Doesn’t Do</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No tax savings</strong> with a revocable living trust — it’s
tax-neutral while you’re alive. Your home still gets a stepped-up cost
basis at death (capital gains benefit for heirs).</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t replace a will</strong> — you still need a
“pour-over will” to catch any assets not in the trust.</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t protect from your own creditors</strong> (revocable
trust).</li>

Trust</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Create the trust document</strong> with an estate attorney
($1,500–$3,000 for a full estate plan)</li>
<li><strong>Transfer the deed</strong> — a new deed is recorded with the
county transferring ownership from “John Smith” to “John Smith, Trustee
of the Smith Family Trust”</li>
<li><strong>Notify your mortgage company</strong> (most mortgages allow
trust transfers without triggering due-on-sale)</li>
<li><strong>Update homeowners insurance</strong> to name the trust as an
additional insured/interest holder</li>
<li><strong>Update property tax records</strong> if needed (in Idaho,
this usually doesn’t trigger reassessment)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="idaho-specific-notes">Idaho-Specific Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Idaho does NOT have a state estate tax (only federal applies, which
exempts ~$13.61M per person / $27.22M per couple in 2024)</li>
<li>Idaho is a <strong>community property state</strong> — both spouses’
shares get a stepped-up basis at the first death (big capital gains
advantage)</li>
<li>Idaho probate is simpler than some states, but a trust still saves
time, money, and privacy</li>
<li><strong>Small estate affidavit</strong> available for estates under
$100,000 in Idaho — but your home likely exceeds this</li>

<h2 id="umbrella-insurance-policy">2. Umbrella Insurance Policy</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h3>
<p>An <strong>umbrella policy</strong> provides extra liability coverage
<strong>above and beyond</strong> your homeowners and auto insurance. If
you’re sued and the judgment exceeds your home or auto policy limits,
the umbrella kicks in.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-need-one-especially-in-retirement">Why You Need One
(Especially in Retirement)</h3>
<p><strong>You Have More to Lose</strong> - By retirement, you’ve
accumulated significant assets — home equity, retirement accounts,
savings. A lawsuit could threaten all of it. - Standard homeowners
insurance typically covers $100K–$300K in liability. Auto covers
$250K–$500K. A serious car accident, slip-and-fall at your property, or
dog bite lawsuit can easily exceed these limits.</p>
<p><strong>Lawsuits Are Expensive</strong> - Average bodily injury claim
from a car accident: ~$20,000–$25,000. But serious injuries can run
$500,000–$2,000,000+. - If someone is injured on your property (guest
falls, pool accident, trampoline injury): $300,000–$1,000,000+ judgments
are common. - If a court judgment exceeds your insurance, <strong>they
come after your personal assets</strong> — home, savings, investments,
future wages.</p>
<p><strong>It’s Incredibly Cheap for What You Get</strong> - $1 million
umbrella policy: <strong>~$150–$300/year</strong> - $2 million umbrella
policy: <strong>~$200–$400/year</strong> - Each additional $1M:
~$50–$100/year more - This is the best value in all of insurance. For
less than $1/day, you protect your entire financial life.</p>
<p><strong>What It Covers</strong> - Bodily injury liability (someone
hurt on your property or in a car accident you cause) - Property damage
liability - Personal liability (libel, slander, defamation claims) -
Landlord liability (if you have rental properties) - Some policies cover
legal defense costs on top of the coverage amount</p>
<p><strong>What It Doesn’t Cover</strong> - Your own injuries or
property damage - Intentional acts or criminal behavior - Business
liability (need a separate business policy) - Workers’ compensation
claims</p>
<h3 id="how-much-coverage-do-you-need">How Much Coverage Do You
Need?</h3>
<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Your umbrella policy should cover at
least your <strong>total net worth</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most insurers require minimum underlying coverage on your home and

<ul>
<li>Auto: typically $250K/$500K bodily injury</li>
<li>Home: typically $300K liability</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bundling discount:</strong> Get your umbrella from the same
company as your home/auto for 10–15% savings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-to-get-it">Where to Get It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Farm, USAA, Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual</strong>
— all offer umbrella policies</li>
<li><strong>USAA</strong> (if eligible — military/veteran connection):

<li>Call your current home/auto insurer first — bundling is
cheapest</li>

<h2 id="durable-power-of-attorney-financial">3. Durable Power of
Attorney — Financial</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-it-1">What Is It?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Durable Financial Power of Attorney (DPOA)</strong> is a
legal document that authorizes someone you trust (your “agent” or
“attorney-in-fact”) to make financial decisions on your behalf if you
become unable to do so.</p>
<p><strong>“Durable”</strong> means it remains in effect even if you
become incapacitated (mentally or physically unable to manage your
affairs). A regular POA expires upon incapacity — which is exactly when
you need it most.</p>
<h3 id="why-its-critical-for-retirement">Why It’s Critical for
Retirement</h3>
<p><strong>Without a DPOA, if you become incapacitated:</strong> - No
one can access your bank accounts to pay bills - No one can manage your
investments - No one can file your taxes - No one can sell property or
access safe deposit boxes - No one can deal with insurance companies,
Medicare, or Social Security on your behalf - Your family must petition
a court for <strong>conservatorship/guardianship</strong> — costs
$3,000–$10,000+, takes months, requires ongoing court supervision, and
is public record</p>
<p><strong>With a DPOA:</strong> - Your chosen agent steps in
immediately - They can pay bills, manage accounts, handle investments,
file taxes, deal with insurance - No court involvement needed - Private,
fast, seamless</p>
<h3 id="what-powers-to-include">What Powers to Include</h3>
<p>A comprehensive financial DPOA should grant authority to:</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Most estate attorneys recommend an
<strong>immediate DPOA</strong> with someone you deeply trust. Springing
POAs create bureaucratic hurdles at the worst possible time.</p>
<h3 id="important-safeguards">Important Safeguards</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name a successor agent</strong> in case your first choice
can’t serve</li>
<li><strong>Require accounting</strong> — agent must keep records of all
transactions</li>
<li><strong>Limit gifting power</strong> if concerned about abuse</li>
<li><strong>Review and update every 3–5 years</strong> — financial
institutions sometimes refuse old POAs</li>
<li><strong>Give copies to your bank and financial institutions
NOW</strong> — many banks have their own POA forms they prefer. Getting
this set up in advance prevents hassle later.</li>

Durable Power of Attorney — Medical (Healthcare Directive)</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-it-2">What Is It?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Durable Healthcare Power of Attorney</strong> (also called
a <strong>Healthcare Proxy</strong> or part of an <strong>Advance
Directive</strong>) authorizes someone you trust to make medical
decisions for you if you can’t make them yourself.</p>
<p>This is typically combined with a <strong>Living Will</strong> into
one document called an <strong>Advance Directive</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-components">The Two Components</h3>
<p><strong>1. Healthcare Power of Attorney (Healthcare Proxy)</strong> -
Names your agent to make medical decisions - They decide treatments,
surgeries, medications, care facilities - Only activates when you can’t
communicate or decide for yourself</p>
<p><strong>2. Living Will</strong> - States your wishes for end-of-life
care <strong>in your own words</strong> - Do you want life-sustaining
treatment if terminally ill? - Do you want artificial
nutrition/hydration? - Do you want CPR? - Organ donation preferences -
Comfort care / pain management preferences</p>
<h3 id="why-its-critical">Why It’s Critical</h3>
<p><strong>Without it:</strong> - Doctors may not know your wishes -
Family members may disagree about your care — leading to conflict, court
battles, and emotional trauma - A court may appoint a guardian to make
your medical decisions — someone you didn’t choose - Think of the Terri
Schiavo case — 15 years of family conflict and court battles, all
preventable with a simple advance directive</p>
<p><strong>With it:</strong> - Your chosen person makes decisions
aligned with your values - Doctors have clear guidance - Family conflict
is minimized - Your autonomy is preserved even when you can’t speak</p>
<h3 id="what-your-agent-can-decide">What Your Agent Can Decide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whether to pursue aggressive treatment or comfort care</li>
<li>Surgical decisions</li>
<li>Medication choices</li>
<li>Which doctors and hospitals</li>
<li>Whether to move you to a different care facility</li>
<li>Whether to discontinue life support (if consistent with your living
will)</li>
<li>Access to your medical records (HIPAA authorization — include
this!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-decisions-to-think-about-now">Key Decisions to Think About
Now</h3>
<p>Have these conversations with your agent BEFORE you need them:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />If terminally ill with no chance of
recovery — do you want life-sustaining treatment?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Ventilator / breathing machine — yes
or no? For how long?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Artificial nutrition (feeding tube)
— yes or no?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />CPR if heart stops — yes or no?
(Consider a DNR if appropriate)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Organ and tissue donation
preferences</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Pain management priorities (comfort
vs. alertness)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Where do you want to receive care?
(Home, hospital, hospice)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Religious or spiritual
considerations for medical care</label></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hipaa-authorization">HIPAA Authorization</h3>
<p><strong>Critical addition:</strong> Include a <strong>HIPAA release
form</strong> that authorizes your healthcare agent (and other family
members you choose) to access your medical records. Without it, doctors
may refuse to share information with your agent due to privacy laws.
Many advance directive templates now include this.</p>
<h3 id="idaho-specific-notes-2">Idaho-Specific Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Idaho uses the <strong>Idaho Advance Directive</strong> form —
available free from the Idaho Attorney General’s office</li>
<li>Must be <strong>signed by you and two witnesses</strong> (witnesses

healthcare facility)</li>
<li><strong>Notarization recommended</strong> but not strictly required

<li>Idaho recognizes <strong>POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining
Treatment)</strong> — a separate medical order form completed with your
doctor for those with serious illness. More specific than a living
will.</li>
